### ðŸ“„ `.gitignore`
**Purpose:** Specifies which files and directories Git should ignore. This helps avoid committing unnecessary or sensitive files, like Python bytecode or model checkpoints.

Example:

```txt
# Python bytecode files
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# Virtual environment
venv/
env/

# Model checkpoints (large files)
models/saved/

# Data files (if not needed in version control)
data/raw/
data/processed/

# Logs
*.log

# Jupyter Notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/
